             AWS Key Management Service 
             <para>
             AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service.
             This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For
             general information about AWS KMS, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/">
             <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.

             AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
             languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide
             a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services.
             For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing
             errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs,
             including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools
             for Amazon Web Services</a>.
             </para>
              </note> 
             <para>
             We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS.

             Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients
             must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral
             Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern
             systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

             Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly
             recommend that you <i>do not</i> use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret
             key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access
             key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary
             security credentials that you can use to sign requests.

             AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events
             for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By
             using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were
             made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more
             about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a

            Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK). You can use
            an alias to identify a CMK in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations">cryptographic
            operations</a>, such as <a>Encrypt</a> and <a>GenerateDataKey</a>. You can change
            the CMK associated with the alias at any time.
            
             
            <para>
            Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications.
            For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses
            by associating a given alias with a different CMK. 
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>.
            Then, in each AWS Region, create an <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code> alias that is
            associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>
            CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            This operation does not return a response. To get the alias that you created, use
            the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            To use aliases successfully, be aware of the following information.
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple
            aliases. The alias and its associated CMK must be in the same AWS account and Region.
            
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and
            Region. However, you do not have permission to associate an alias with an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk">AWS
            managed CMK</a> or an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-owned-cmk">AWS

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the <a>UpdateAlias</a> operation.
            The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric)
            and they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>).
            This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            The alias name must begin with <code>alias/</code> followed by a name, such as <code>alias/ExampleAlias</code>.
            It can contain only alphanumeric characters, forward slashes (/), underscores (_),
            and dashes (-). The alias name cannot begin with <code>alias/aws/</code>. The <code>alias/aws/</code>
            prefix is reserved for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#aws-managed-cmk">AWS
            managed CMKs</a>.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you can use the same
            alias name in multiple Regions of the same AWS account. Each instance of the alias
            is associated with a CMK in its Region.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use
            the <a>DeleteAlias</a> operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with
            the desired name.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations">cryptographic
            operations</a> and in the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. However, you cannot use alias
            names or alias ARNs in API operations that manage CMKs, such as <a>DisableKey</a>
            or <a>GetKeyPolicy</a>. For information about the valid CMK identifiers for each AWS
            KMS API operation, see the descriptions of the <code>KeyId</code> parameter in the
            API operation documentation.

             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases
            of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from
            the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases and alias ARNs of CMKs in each
            AWS account and Region, use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.

            You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric
            or asymmetric CMK. When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption
            algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric
            and asymmetric CMKs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using
            Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS
            by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext
            produced by other libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">AWS
            Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon
            S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is
            incompatible with AWS KMS.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, you do not need to specify
            the CMK or the encryption algorithm. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata
            that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, if you prefer, you can specify
            the <code>KeyId</code> to ensure that a particular CMK is used to decrypt the ciphertext.
            If you specify a different CMK than the one used to encrypt the ciphertext, the <code>Decrypt</code>
            operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation
            on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an
            IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could
            decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy
            for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code>
            permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details,

            <summary>
            Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The <code>Encrypt</code>
            operation has two primary use cases:
            
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identifier or
            database password, or other sensitive information. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            You can use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation to move encrypted data from one AWS
            Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use the plaintext
            key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation
            to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted
            data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted
            data key and the encrypted data entirely within in Region B.
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            You don't need to use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation to encrypt a data key. The
            <a>GenerateDataKey</a> and <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> operations return a plaintext
            data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the
            encryption operation. The CMK must have a <code>KeyUsage</code> value of <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.</code>
            To find the <code>KeyUsage</code> of a CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.
            
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security
            to your encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code> when
            encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact
            match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>.
            For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context">Encryption
            Context</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm.
            The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.
            </para>
             <important> 
            <para>
            When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the
            CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the
            same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm
            do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
            with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.
            AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
            format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.
            </para>
             </important> 
            <para>
            The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK and

            For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or
            prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported
            by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in

            The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must identify the <i>source
            CMK</i>, that is, the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the
            encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the ciphertext was encrypted
            under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using
            a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the <code>ReEncrypt</code>
            operation fails.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To reencrypt the data, you must specify the <i>destination CMK</i>, that is, the CMK
            that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric
            CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption
            algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.

            When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the
            CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the
            same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm
            do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
            with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.
            AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
            format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

            This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an

            <summary>
            Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a different customer master key (CMK). Each
            alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, although a CMK can have multiple
            aliases. The alias and the CMK must be in the same AWS account and region. You cannot
            perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. 
            
             
            <para>
            The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric),
            and they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>).
            This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an
            alias to a different type of CMK, use <a>DeleteAlias</a> to delete the old alias and
            <a>CreateAlias</a> to create a new alias.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You cannot use <code>UpdateAlias</code> to change an alias name. To change an alias
            name, use <a>DeleteAlias</a> to delete the old alias and <a>CreateAlias</a> to create
            a new alias.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the
            aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response
            from the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account,
            use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.

            <para>

            A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The
            signature is verified by using the public key in the same asymmetric CMK. For information
            about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using

            You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside

            asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS
            KMS. The advantage of using the <code>Verify</code> operation is that it is performed
            within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within
            the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and
            IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures.

             AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming
             languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide
             a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services.
             For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing
             errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs,
             including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools

             key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access
             key for an IAM user. You can also use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary
             security credentials that you can use to sign requests.

             AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events
             for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By
             using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were
             made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more

            Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK). You can use

            Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications.
            For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses
            by associating a given alias with a different CMK.

            <para>
            To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>.
            Then, in each AWS Region, create an <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code> alias that is
            associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>
            CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code.

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple

            <para>
            You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and

            To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the <a>UpdateAlias</a> operation.
            The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric)
            and they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>).
            This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.

            The alias name must begin with <code>alias/</code> followed by a name, such as <code>alias/ExampleAlias</code>.

            <para>
            After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use

            the desired name.

            Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases
            of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from
            the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases and alias ARNs of CMKs in each
            AWS account and Region, use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.

            not going to use your custom key store immediately, you might want to connect it to

            be used outside of AWS KMS. CMKs with RSA key pairs can be used to encrypt or decrypt
            data or sign and verify messages (but not both). CMKs with ECC key pairs can be used
            only to sign and verify messages.

            <para>
            To create an asymmetric CMK, use the <code>CustomerMasterKeySpec</code> parameter
            to specify the type of key material in the CMK. Then, use the <code>KeyUsage</code>
            parameter to determine whether the CMK will be used to encrypt and decrypt or sign
            and verify. You can't change these properties after the CMK is created.

            When creating a symmetric CMK, you don't need to specify the <code>CustomerMasterKeySpec</code>
            or <code>KeyUsage</code> parameters. The default value for <code>CustomerMasterKeySpec</code>,
            <code>SYMMETRIC_DEFAULT</code>, and the default value for <code>KeyUsage</code>, <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code>,
            are the only valid values for symmetric CMKs.

            <para>
            To import your own key material, begin by creating a symmetric CMK with no key material.
            To do this, use the <code>Origin</code> parameter of <code>CreateKey</code> with a
            value of <code>EXTERNAL</code>. Next, use <a>GetParametersForImport</a> operation
            to get a public key and import token, and use the public key to encrypt your key material.
            Then, use <a>ImportKeyMaterial</a> with your import token to import the key material.

            You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric

            The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS
            by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext
            produced by other libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">AWS
            Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon

            <para>
            If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, you do not need to specify
            the CMK or the encryption algorithm. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata
            that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, if you prefer, you can specify
            the <code>KeyId</code> to ensure that a particular CMK is used to decrypt the ciphertext.
            If you specify a different CMK than the one used to encrypt the ciphertext, the <code>Decrypt</code>
            operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation
            on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an
            IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could
            decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy
            for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code>
            permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts.

            Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The <code>Encrypt</code>
            operation has two primary use cases:
            
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identifier or
            database password, or other sensitive information. 
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            You can use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation to move encrypted data from one AWS
            Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use the plaintext
            key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation
            to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted
            data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted
            data key and the encrypted data entirely within in Region B.
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            You don't need to use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation to encrypt a data key. The
            <a>GenerateDataKey</a> and <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> operations return a plaintext
            data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the
            encryption operation. The CMK must have a <code>KeyUsage</code> value of <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.</code>
            To find the <code>KeyUsage</code> of a CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.
            
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security
            to your encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code> when
            encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact
            match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>.
            For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context">Encryption
            Context</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you specify an asymmetric CMK, you must also specify the encryption algorithm.
            The algorithm must be compatible with the CMK type.
            </para>
             <important> 
            <para>
            When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the
            CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the
            same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm
            do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
            with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.
            AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
            format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.
            </para>
             </important> 
            <para>
            The maximum size of the data that you can encrypt varies with the type of CMK and
            the encryption algorithm that you choose.

            You can use the public key that <code>GenerateDataKeyPair</code> returns to encrypt
            data or verify a signature outside of AWS KMS. Then, store the encrypted private key

            To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric customer master key (CMK)
            to encrypt the private key in a data key pair. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK or
            a CMK in a custom key store. To get the type and origin of your CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a>

            operation. <code>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</code> returns a plaintext public
            key and an encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need
            only to decrypt ciphertext or sign a message. Later, when you need to decrypt the
            data or sign a message, use the <a>Decrypt</a> operation to decrypt the encrypted

            You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption

            Generates a unique symmetric data key. This operation returns a data key that is encrypted
            under a customer master key (CMK) that you specify. To request an asymmetric data
            key pair, use the <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> or <a>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</a>
            operations.
            
             
            <para>
             <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> is identical to the <a>GenerateDataKey</a>
            operation except that returns only the encrypted copy of the data key. This operation
            is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately.
            When you need to encrypt the data, you call the <a>Decrypt</a> operation on the encrypted
            copy of the key.

            <para>
            It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example,
            you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates
            new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different
            component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data
            key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the
            container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component
            that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.

             <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> returns a unique data key for each request.
            The bytes in the keys are not related to the caller or CMK that is used to encrypt
            the private key.

            <para>
            To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric customer master key (CMK) that
            is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK to generate a data
            key. To get the type of your CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If the operation succeeds, you will find the encrypted copy of the data key in the
            <code>CiphertextBlob</code> field.

            <para>
            You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption
            operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code>, you must specify the
            same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted
            data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>.

            Returns the public key of an asymmetric CMK. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric
            CMK, which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with <code>kms:GetPublicKey</code>
            permission can download the public key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public

            You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within
            AWS KMS by calling the <a>Encrypt</a>, <a>ReEncrypt</a>, or <a>Verify</a> operations
            with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the public key within AWS KMS,
            you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every
            AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted.
            These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations">Special

            Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial
            that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly.
            For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or
            prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported
            by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in
            a verification operation.

            The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
            using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as <a>Encrypt</a> or <a>GenerateDataKey</a>.
            It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an <a
            href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symm-asymm-concepts.html#asymmetric-cmks">asymmetric
            CMK</a> outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other
            libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">AWS
            Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon
            S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is
            incompatible with AWS KMS.

            <para>
            When you use the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation, you need to provide information
            for the decrypt operation and the subsequent encrypt operation.
            </para>
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must identify the <i>source
            CMK</i>, that is, the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the
            encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the ciphertext was encrypted
            under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using
            a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the <code>ReEncrypt</code>
            operation fails.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To reencrypt the data, you must specify the <i>destination CMK</i>, that is, the CMK
            that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric
            CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption
            algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.
            </para>
             <important> 
            <para>
            When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the
            CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the
            same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm
            do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
            with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.
            AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
            format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

             </important> </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, <code>ReEncrypt</code> callers must have two

            <para>

             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the <code>"kms:ReEncrypt*"</code>
            permission in your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html">key
            policy</a>. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use
            the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK
            programmatically or when you use the <a>PutKeyPolicy</a> operation to set a key policy.

            The CMK that you use for this operation must be in a compatible key state. For details,

            Digital signatures are generated and verified by using asymmetric key pair, such as
            an RSA or ECC pair that is represented by an asymmetric customer master key (CMK).
            The key owner (or an authorized user) uses their private key to sign a message. Anyone
            with the public key can verify that the message was signed with that particular private
            key and that the message hasn't changed since it was signed.

            a hash digest of the message, and then provide the hash digest in the <code>Message</code>

            A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The

            To verify a digital signature, you can use the <code>Verify</code> operation. Specify

            You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside

            asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS
            KMS. The advantage of using the <code>Verify</code> operation is that it is performed
            within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within
            the FIPS boundary, it is logged in AWS CloudTrail, and you can use key policy and
            IAM policy to determine who is authorized to use the CMK to verify signatures.

            Creates a display name for a customer managed customer master key (CMK). You can use

            <para>
            Aliases are easier to remember than key IDs. They can also help to simplify your applications.
            For example, if you use an alias in your code, you can change the CMK your code uses
            by associating a given alias with a different CMK.

            <para>
            To run the same code in multiple AWS regions, use an alias in your code, such as <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>.
            Then, in each AWS Region, create an <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code> alias that is
            associated with a CMK in that Region. When you run your code, it uses the <code>alias/ApplicationKey</code>
            CMK for that AWS Region without any Region-specific code.

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            Each alias points to only one CMK at a time, although a single CMK can have multiple

            <para>
            You can associate an alias with any customer managed CMK in the same AWS account and

            To change the CMK associated with an alias, use the <a>UpdateAlias</a> operation.
            The current CMK and the new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric)
            and they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>).
            This restriction prevents cryptographic errors in code that uses aliases.

            The alias name must be unique within an AWS Region. However, you can use the same

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            After you create an alias, you cannot change its alias name. However, you can use
            the <a>DeleteAlias</a> operation to delete the alias and then create a new alias with
            the desired name.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            You can use an alias name or alias ARN to identify a CMK in AWS KMS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#cryptographic-operations">cryptographic
            operations</a> and in the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. However, you cannot use alias

             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can delete and change the aliases
            of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response from
            the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases and alias ARNs of CMKs in each

            <para>
            If you don't set <code>BypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck</code> to true, the key policy
            must allow the principal that is making the <code>CreateKey</code> request to make

            including the new principal in a key policy because the new principal might not be
            immediately visible to AWS KMS. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/troubleshoot_general.html#troubleshoot_general_eventual-consistency">Changes

            You can use this operation to decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted under a symmetric
            or asymmetric CMK. When the CMK is asymmetric, you must specify the CMK and the encryption
            algorithm that was used to encrypt the ciphertext. For information about symmetric
            and asymmetric CMKs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using
            Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.

            <para>
            The Decrypt operation also decrypts ciphertext that was encrypted outside of AWS KMS
            by the public key in an AWS KMS asymmetric CMK. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext
            produced by other libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">AWS
            Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon
            S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is
            incompatible with AWS KMS.

            <para>
            If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, you do not need to specify
            the CMK or the encryption algorithm. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata
            that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. However, if you prefer, you can specify
            the <code>KeyId</code> to ensure that a particular CMK is used to decrypt the ciphertext.
            If you specify a different CMK than the one used to encrypt the ciphertext, the <code>Decrypt</code>
            operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the Decrypt operation
            on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an
            IAM user policy that gives the user Decrypt permission on all CMKs. This user could
            decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy
            for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code>
            permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts.

            like <code>KeySpec</code>, that help you distinguish symmetric from asymmetric CMKs.
            It also provides information that is particularly important to asymmetric CMKs, such

            algorithms that the CMK supports.

            Container for the parameters to the Encrypt operation.
            Encrypts plaintext into ciphertext by using a customer master key (CMK). The <code>Encrypt</code>
            operation has two primary use cases:
            
             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            You can encrypt small amounts of arbitrary data, such as a personal identifier or

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            You can use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation to move encrypted data from one AWS
            Region to another. For example, in Region A, generate a data key and use the plaintext
            key to encrypt your data. Then, in Region A, use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation
            to encrypt the plaintext data key under a CMK in Region B. Now, you can move the encrypted
            data and the encrypted data key to Region B. When necessary, you can decrypt the encrypted
            data key and the encrypted data entirely within in Region B.
            </para>
             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            You don't need to use the <code>Encrypt</code> operation to encrypt a data key. The
            <a>GenerateDataKey</a> and <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> operations return a plaintext
            data key and an encrypted copy of that data key.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            When you encrypt data, you must specify a symmetric or asymmetric CMK to use in the
            encryption operation. The CMK must have a <code>KeyUsage</code> value of <code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT.</code>
            To find the <code>KeyUsage</code> of a CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.
            
            </para>
             
            <para>
            If you use a symmetric CMK, you can use an encryption context to add additional security
            to your encryption operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code> when
            encrypting data, you must specify the same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact
            match) when decrypting the data. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>.
            For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#encrypt_context">Encryption

            When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the
            CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the
            same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm
            do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.

            You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
            with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.
            AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
            format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

            To generate a data key pair, you must specify a symmetric customer master key (CMK)

            key and an encrypted private key, but omits the plaintext private key that you need

            You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption

            An <i>encryption context</i> is a collection of non-secret key-value pairs that represents

            Container for the parameters to the GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext operation.
            Generates a unique symmetric data key. This operation returns a data key that is encrypted
            under a customer master key (CMK) that you specify. To request an asymmetric data
            key pair, use the <a>GenerateDataKeyPair</a> or <a>GenerateDataKeyPairWithoutPlaintext</a>
            operations.

             <code>GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext</code> is identical to the <a>GenerateDataKey</a>

            is useful for systems that need to encrypt data at some point, but not immediately.
            When you need to encrypt the data, you call the <a>Decrypt</a> operation on the encrypted

            It's also useful in distributed systems with different levels of trust. For example,
            you might store encrypted data in containers. One component of your system creates
            new containers and stores an encrypted data key with each container. Then, a different
            component puts the data into the containers. That component first decrypts the data
            key, uses the plaintext data key to encrypt data, puts the encrypted data into the
            container, and then destroys the plaintext data key. In this system, the component
            that creates the containers never sees the plaintext data key.

            To generate a data key, you must specify the symmetric customer master key (CMK) that
            is used to encrypt the data key. You cannot use an asymmetric CMK to generate a data
            key. To get the type of your CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.

            You can use the optional encryption context to add additional security to the encryption
            operation. If you specify an <code>EncryptionContext</code>, you must specify the
            same encryption context (a case-sensitive exact match) when decrypting the encrypted
            data key. Otherwise, the request to decrypt fails with an <code>InvalidCiphertextException</code>.

            Returns the public key of an asymmetric CMK. Unlike the private key of a asymmetric
            CMK, which never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted, callers with <code>kms:GetPublicKey</code>
            permission can download the public key of an asymmetric CMK. You can share the public

            For information about symmetric and asymmetric CMKs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/symmetric-asymmetric.html">Using
            Symmetric and Asymmetric CMKs</a> in the <i>AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.
            
             
            <para>
            You do not need to download the public key. Instead, you can use the public key within
            AWS KMS by calling the <a>Encrypt</a>, <a>ReEncrypt</a>, or <a>Verify</a> operations
            with the identifier of an asymmetric CMK. When you use the public key within AWS KMS,
            you benefit from the authentication, authorization, and logging that are part of every
            AWS KMS operation. You also reduce of risk of encrypting data that cannot be decrypted.
            These features are not effective outside of AWS KMS. For details, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/download-public-key.html#download-public-key-considerations">Special

            Although AWS KMS cannot enforce these restrictions on external operations, it is crucial
            that you use this information to prevent the public key from being used improperly.
            For example, you can prevent a public signing key from being used encrypt data, or
            prevent a public key from being used with an encryption algorithm that is not supported
            by AWS KMS. You can also avoid errors, such as using the wrong signing algorithm in
            a verification operation.

            CMK</a>. Grant constraints are not applied to operations that do not support an encryption
            context, such as cryptographic operations with asymmetric CMKs and management operations,
            such as <a>DescribeKey</a> or <a>ScheduleKeyDeletion</a>.

             <important> 
            <para>
            In a cryptographic operation, the encryption context in the decryption operation must
            be an exact, case-sensitive match for the keys and values in the encryption context
            of the encryption operation. Only the order of the pairs can vary.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            However, in a grant constraint, the key in each key-value pair is not case sensitive,

            To avoid confusion, do not use multiple encryption context pairs that differ only

            By default, the ListAliases command returns all aliases in the account and region.
            To get only the aliases that point to a particular customer master key (CMK), use
            the <code>KeyId</code> parameter.

            <para>
            The <code>ListAliases</code> response can include aliases that you created and associated
            with your customer managed CMKs, and aliases that AWS created and associated with
            AWS managed CMKs in your account. You can recognize AWS aliases because their names
            have the format <code>aws/&lt;service-name&gt;</code>, such as <code>aws/dynamodb</code>.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            The response might also include aliases that have no <code>TargetKeyId</code> field.
            These are predefined aliases that AWS has created but has not yet associated with
            a CMK. Aliases that AWS creates in your account, including predefined aliases, do

            <para>
            The <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation can decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by
            using an AWS KMS CMK in an AWS KMS operation, such as <a>Encrypt</a> or <a>GenerateDataKey</a>.
            It can also decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by using the public key of an <a

            CMK</a> outside of AWS KMS. However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other
            libraries, such as the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/">AWS
            Encryption SDK</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html">Amazon
            S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is
            incompatible with AWS KMS.

            <para>
            When you use the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation, you need to provide information

             <ul> <li> 
            <para>
            If your ciphertext was encrypted under an asymmetric CMK, you must identify the <i>source
            CMK</i>, that is, the CMK that encrypted the ciphertext. You must also supply the
            encryption algorithm that was used. This information is required to decrypt the data.
            </para>
             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            It is optional, but you can specify a source CMK even when the ciphertext was encrypted
            under a symmetric CMK. This ensures that the ciphertext is decrypted only by using
            a particular CMK. If the CMK that you specify cannot decrypt the ciphertext, the <code>ReEncrypt</code>
            operation fails.

             </li> <li> 
            <para>
            To reencrypt the data, you must specify the <i>destination CMK</i>, that is, the CMK
            that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric
            CMK. If the destination CMK is an asymmetric CMK, you must also provide the encryption
            algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the CMK.

            When you use an asymmetric CMK to encrypt or reencrypt data, be sure to record the
            CMK and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the
            same CMK and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the CMK and algorithm
            do not match the values used to encrypt the data, the decrypt operation fails.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You are not required to supply the CMK ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt
            with symmetric CMKs because AWS KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.
            AWS KMS cannot store metadata in ciphertext generated with asymmetric keys. The standard
            format for asymmetric key ciphertext does not include configurable fields.

            Unlike other AWS KMS API operations, <code>ReEncrypt</code> callers must have two

            <para>

             </li> </ul> 
            <para>
            To permit reencryption from or to a CMK, include the <code>"kms:ReEncrypt*"</code>
            permission in your <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html">key
            policy</a>. This permission is automatically included in the key policy when you use
            the console to create a CMK. But you must include it manually when you create a CMK
            programmatically or when you use the <a>PutKeyPolicy</a> operation to set a key policy.

            To find the <code>KeyUsage</code> of a CMK, use the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation.

            <para>
            To specify a CMK, use its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias name, or alias
            ARN. When using an alias name, prefix it with <code>"alias/"</code>. To specify a
            CMK in a different AWS account, you must use the key ARN or alias ARN.

            Container for the parameters to the UpdateAlias operation.
            Associates an existing AWS KMS alias with a different customer master key (CMK). Each
            alias is associated with only one CMK at a time, although a CMK can have multiple
            aliases. The alias and the CMK must be in the same AWS account and region. You cannot
            perform this operation on an alias in a different AWS account. 
            
             
            <para>
            The current and new CMK must be the same type (both symmetric or both asymmetric),
            and they must have the same key usage (<code>ENCRYPT_DECRYPT</code> or <code>SIGN_VERIFY</code>).
            This restriction prevents errors in code that uses aliases. If you must assign an
            alias to a different type of CMK, use <a>DeleteAlias</a> to delete the old alias and
            <a>CreateAlias</a> to create a new alias.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You cannot use <code>UpdateAlias</code> to change an alias name. To change an alias
            name, use <a>DeleteAlias</a> to delete the old alias and <a>CreateAlias</a> to create
            a new alias.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            Because an alias is not a property of a CMK, you can create, update, and delete the
            aliases of a CMK without affecting the CMK. Also, aliases do not appear in the response
            from the <a>DescribeKey</a> operation. To get the aliases of all CMKs in the account,
            use the <a>ListAliases</a> operation.

            A digital signature is generated by using the private key in an asymmetric CMK. The

            To verify a digital signature, you can use the <code>Verify</code> operation. Specify
            the same asymmetric CMK, message, and signing algorithm that were used to produce
            the signature.
            </para>
             
            <para>
            You can also verify the digital signature by using the public key of the CMK outside
            of AWS KMS. Use the <a>GetPublicKey</a> operation to download the public key in the
            asymmetric CMK and then use the public key to verify the signature outside of AWS
            KMS. The advantage of using the <code>Verify</code> operation is that it is performed
            within AWS KMS. As a result, it's easy to call, the operation is performed within

            this class.
            This constructor should be used to construct constants that are not
            defined as statics, for instance if attempting to use a feature that is
            newer than the current version of the SDK.
